# D.E.L.T.A-Discovery-Extraction-of-Localized-Technical-Anomalies-

## The Challenge: 
Standard search engines are useless for finding locations that don't want to be found. 

## The Solution:
I built an LLM-orchestrated surveillance interface. It doesn't search for "names"; it searches for environmental signatures. The Impact: By feeding the Llama 3.3 model complex geospatial constraints, I can identify "Geospatial Null-Zones"—locations where topographical data and thermal readings suggest the presence of non-indexed, high-tech infrastructure.

## Core Workflow:

1) User inputs a tactical signature (e.g., "vibrational dampening in a hidden valley").

2) Groq (Llama 3.3) reasons through global tectonic and infrastructure data to generate probable coordinates.

3) CesiumJS executes a 3D "Slam-Zoom" to the location for visual verification.

4) FPDF generates a hard-copy intelligence report for the field.
